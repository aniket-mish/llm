#### SYNOPSIS

About 2040, October 30, 1959, Piedmont Airlines Flight 349
crashed on Bucks Elbow Mountain located about 13 miles
west of the Charlottesville-Albemarle County, Virginia,
Airport. The crew of 3 and 23 of 24 passengers were killed;


the sole survivor was seriously injured. The aircraft, a DC-3,
N 55V, was demolished by impact.

From the available evidence it is the determination of the
Board that this accident occurred during an intended
instrument approach. More specifically, it occurred during
the inbound portion of the procedure turn which was being
flown 8 to 11 miles west of the maneuvering area prescribed
by the instrument approach procedure.

The Board concludes that the lateral error resulted from a
navigational omission which took place when the pilot did
not turn left about 20 degrees in conformity to V-140 airway
at the Casanova omni range station. Consequently, when the
pilots believed the flight was over the Rochelle intersection
it was in fact 13 miles northwest of that position. As a result
of this position, when the pilot turned left and flew the
heading normally flown from Rochelle intersection, the path
of the aircraft over the ground was displaced 8 to 11 miles
west of the prescribed track. The Board further concludes
that the error was undetected because tracking and other
instrument approach requirements were not followed
precisely.

From information regarding the personal background of
Captain Lavrinc and expert medical analysis of this
information, it is the Board's opinion that preoccupation
resulting from mental stress may have been a contributing
factor in the accident cause.


Investigation (See Attachment A for reference.)

Piedmont Airlines Flight 349 was a regularly scheduled
flight between Washington, D.C., and Roanoke, Virginia,
with intermediate stops at Charlottesville and Lynchburg,
Virginia. On October 30, 1959, the assigned flight crew
consisted of Captain George Lavrinc, First Officer Bascom
Haley, and Purser George Hicks.

The aircraft departed Washington at 1949.[^1 ] It was about 20
minutes behind schedule, the result of traffic, ground, and
ramp delays. The flight was according to an instrument
flight plan and clearance which specified a routing over
airway V-140 and a cruising altitude of 4,000 feet.[^2 ] At
departure the gross takeoff weight of DC-3, N 55V, was
25,346 pounds, which was also the maximum allowable
weight. The load was properly distributed.

The flight made a Georgetown departure and then proceeded
to the Springfield, Virginia, radio beacon where it entered V-
140 airway. It followed the airway from Springfield to the
Casanova omni range station. The centerline of the airway
over this segment is defined as the 260-degree radial of the
Casanova omni. At 2012[^3 ] Flight 349 reported that it was
over Casanova at 2010. It also reported it was at 4,000 feet
and estimating the Rochelle intersection at 2024, with
Charlottesville next.


At Casanova, V-140 airway turns left and from Casanova to
the Rochelle intersection the airway is defined as the 239-
degree radial of Casanova omni; the distance is 31 miles.[^4 ]
The Rochelle intersection is the 239-degree radial of the
Casanova omni and the 335-degree radial of the
Gordonsville omni.

About 2018 Flight 349 made a routine inrange report to the
Piedmont ground radio station located at the Charlottesville
Airport. The flight informed the company that it was in
range, IFR (instrument flight rules), and would have 250
gallons of fuel on board when it departed Charlottesville for
Lynchburg. The radio operator furnished the flight the latest
altimeter setting, 30.47, and the current surface wind which
was calm. Normally, the operator would also furnish the
latest ceiling and visibility observation. This, according to
his testimony, he failed to do. The current observation at this
time was Ceiling, measured 1,500 feet broken, 4,000 feet
overcast; visibility 10 miles.

Immediately after 2025 the flight reported to the Washington
Air Traffic Control Center that it was over the Rochelle
intersection at 2025 at 4,000 feet and estimating the
Charlottesville Airport at 2030. Washington Center
acknowledged and cleared Flight 349 for an instrument
approach. About one minute later the flight informed the
center as follows, "You can put us out of four thousand."
This was the last transmission from the aircraft.


Investigation revealed the weather observations for
Charlottesville were, at 1900, 1,700 feet scattered, ceiling
4,000 feet, overcast, visibility 10 miles; at 1930, ceiling
1,700 feet broken, 4,000 overcast, at 2000, ceiling measured
1,500 feet broken, 4,000 feet overcast, visibility 10 miles,
wind calm; at 2100, ceiling measured 1,500 feet broken,
2,400 feet overcast, visibility 10 miles, wind calm. A study
of the weather observations from other stations in the area
showed the Charlottesville conditions should have been
substantially as reported. The situation, however, showed
that conditions would be much worse in the area near and
parallel to the mountains west of Charlottesville. In this area
the mountains were obscured and visual flight would not
have been possible.

Studies of the winds aloft by the U. S. Weather Bureau
showed that at altitudes used by Flight 349 they were
predominantly southerly and averaged about 15 knots.

When the flight did not land as anticipated a radio search
was made, which proved futile. A ground search was begun
as quickly as possible and supplemented by an air search the
next day. Throughout that day both were seriously hampered
by bad weather. On November 1, about 0800, the wreckage
was sighted from a helicopter on the southern slope of
Bucks Elbow Mountain, which is located about 13 miles
west of the Charlottesville Airport. It was almost hidden by
dense tree cover.


Investigation at the scans showed the aircraft crashed where
the upslope of the 3,100—foot mountain was nearly 30
degrees. It crashed against the rocky slope on a magnetic
heading of 3h0—350 degrees and at an elevation of
approximately 2,600 feet. Initial contact occurred when the
right wing of N 55V struck and cut through several trees
which progressively tore off the right wing outboard of the
landing light. At initial impact the right wing was down
about 10 degrees from level and the aircraft was descending
slightly. The aircraft was yawed to the right and rolled to the
right when, about 180 feet farther, it crashed against the
upslope.

In the final impact the forward fuselage rearward to the
center section was destroyed. The fuselage was broken from
the center section and displaced to the left so it rested on the
left wing outboard of the attach angle. The fuselage was also
cooked to the left about 15 degrees relative to the center
section. Most of the fuselage from over the center section
rearward to the cabin door was destroyed or badly crushed.
All of the passenger seats were torn from the floor, including
the one in which the surviving passenger remained fastened
when he was thrown clear of the fuselage.

The structural investigation determined that the landing gear
was extended at impact and the flaps were fully retracted.
Also, although the aircraft sustained great damage, it was
reliably determined that there was no malfunction or failure
of the aircraft prior to impact.


Examination of the engines and propellers disclosed no
evidence of malfunction prior to impact. Evidence showed
that both engines were operating and developing appreciable
power when the aircraft struck the mountain, the specific
amount of power, however, could not be determined.
Evidence also showed that at that time both propellers were
capable of normal operation. Examination and bench checks
where required showed the engine accessories were capable
of normal operation before the impact.

Mr. Phil Bradley, the sole survivor, stated that the flight
seemed perfectly normal until the crash. His description of
the weather indicated that except for the initial portion, the
flight was made in instrument weather conditions. He noted
this when he periodically peered through the cabin window
from his seat. He also noted reflected light from the
anticollision light. Mr. Bradley stated the flight was a little
rough and except for a short period following takeoff the
"fasten seat belt" sign was on until the crash.

The survivor stated there was no indication of any difficulty.
He said the cabin lights were on and the engines sounded
normal. He said that a few minutes before and at the time of
the crash the cabin was quiet and all passengers were seated.
He said both pilots were in the pilot compartment and the
purser was attending to his duties.

Mr. Bradley said the plane made several turns, although he
was not sure of the amount or direction. One such turn, and


seemingly the largest, occured a few minutes before the
crash. He, at first, thought the turn was about 180 degrees
but later felt it was more in the order of 90 degrees.

The witness said he had just folded his arms and was
looking at his wrist watch when the crash occurred, it was

2040. He said his watch was an accurate timepiece and he
had checked it against an airport clock earlier that day. In
this connection, other watches were recovered and some had
been impact stopped. These showed various times which
bracketed 2040.

The approach procedure for the Charlottesville Airport 13 is
an ADF (automatic direction finder) procedure performed on
a Piedmont-owned and operated comer beacon facility. The
night landing minima for Piedmont DC-3 aircraft are.
Ceiling 400 feet, visibility 1 mile.

The current Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) approach
procedure as applicable to Flight 349 would begin at the
Rochelle intersection. According to the procedure in effect
at the time of the accident, when Rochelle was reached the
flight would transition off V-140 airway in a left turn to a
heading of 212 degrees. It would then establish and fly a
212-degree track to the Charlottesville (CHO) homer
beacon, which transmits on 284 kcs. As an additional aid,
though not required, the company owns and operates
another homer beacon, Earlyville (EVL), which transmits on
266 kcs. Charlottesville, the outer homer, is located 4.


nautical miles from the approach end of runway 3 and about
15.5 miles from the Rochelle intersection.

In normal execution of the instrument procedure most
Piedmont pilots use both homer facilities, tuning one ADF
to the Charlottesville homer, 284 kcs., and the other to the
Earlyville beacon, 266 kcs. In addition, many of the pilots
also check passage of the Charlottesville homer by using the
Gordonsville omni, set to the 287-degree radial which
passes through the homer. Some, at the same time, also
check passage of the Earlyville facility by using the second
omni set, tuned to the 301-degree radial of Gordonsville.

When Board investigators attempted to plot the Rochelle
intersection and airport locations, it was noted that the
magnetic heading from Rochelle to the Charlottesville
homer, as depleted on the ADA Form 511 and thus on the
approach plate, was in error. The correct heading should
have been 201 degrees instead of 212. The error resulted
from not amending the heading when, several months
earlier, the course of V-140 airway was shifted slightly. In
this accident the error loses significance because, according
to the flight plan for Trip 349, the correct heading was used.
Further, the use of tracking procedures in flight would
eliminate the effect of the erroneous heading. Nevertheless,
the attention of both the FAA and the company was
immediately directed to the error for correction.


According to the instrument approach procedure, upon
reaching the Charlottesville homer beacon an outbound
track of 207 degrees should be flown, normally for 1 to 1-
1/2 minutes. This is followed by a standard procedure turn
on the southeast side of the track. Using the standard
procedure turn, the outbound heading is 162 degrees and the
inbound heading is 342 degrees. The final approach track to
the airport is 027 degrees.

Descent below 3,000 feet is not authorized prior to the final
approach; then a descent is permitted to not less than 2,
feet before reaching the Charlottesville homer. Thereafter,
descent may be continued to the authorized comm altitude
of 1,039 feet, or 400 feet above airport elevation.

From the Rochelle intersection the entire instrument
approach to landing in the DC-3 takes approximately 15
minutes. From Rochelle to the inbound heading of the
procedure turn about 10-11 minutes' time is normally
required. It appears important to note that based on the
reported time of Flight 349 over Rochelle, 2025, and the
crash time indicated by Mr. Bradley, 2040, the elapsed time
was approximately 15 minutes.

Although the radio and navigational equipment from N 55V
was badly damaged and some portions were destroyed,
information which was important to the investigation was
available. Examination of the omni equipment disclosed that
both receivers were tuned to 115.3 mcs., the Gordonsville


omni range frequency. It was also learned that the right omni
bearing indicator was set to select the 301-degree radial or,
as previously indicated, the radial which passes through the
Earlyville homer. The radial selected on the other unit could
not be determined

Examination of the various components of the red and green
ADP units disclosed both receivers were positioned to select
band 1, the 200-401 kcs. range. It was determined that the
red ADF unit was tuned to 265 kcs., or approximately the
frequency of the Earlyville homer, 266 kcs. Impact damage
to the green ADF made the most reliable indication of the
frequency setting the position of the frequency selector.
This, slightly damaged and locked in position, was set on
286 kcs., or close to the frequency of the Charlottesville
homer, 28h kcs.

Examination of the ADF loop assemblies revealed that the
position of the red ADF loop was equivalent to a bearing of
91 degrees on the cockpit needle. On the same basis the
green ADF was positioned on a bearing of 112 degrees. The
loop positions are most reliable as to the positions of the
needles on the ADF instrument; however, this cockpit
instrument, except the face, was destroyed. It is significant
that with the aircraft on the crash heading of about 345
degrees the bearings of 91 and 112 degrees extended from
the crash site pass very close to the Earlyville and
Charlottesville homer locations, respectively. Further, the
21-degree angle between the loop bearings extended from


the accident site to the radio facilities subtend an arc equal
in miles to the distance between the homers.

Both aircraft altimeters were found. The right indicated an
altitude of 9,200 feet and was set to a barometric setting of
30.43. The left instrument showed about 2,520 feet and a
barometric setting of 30.40. The elevation of the accident
location was 2,600 feet. The last altimeter setting given the
flight was 30 47. Other flight instruments were damaged to
such an extent that no useful information was obtained.

An exhaustive flight check was made of all of the various
navigational ground facilities pertinent to Flight 349. The
checks were made to determine what, if any, condition
existed which might have led the flight into the mountain, or
if the facilities were functioning within FAA operating
standards. To this end nearly 25 hours were flown on the
facilities. The checks were flown shortly after the accident
and at various times, night and day, thereafter. With Board
investigators aboard, they were flown by the FAA Flight
Inspection Branch using an especially equipped aircraft for
the purpose, by the FAA Air Carrier Branch, and by
Piedmont in its own equipment. No discrepancies were
found.

In addition, at the request of the Board the Federal
Communications Commission entered the investigation.
With special equipment and expert personnel, investigation
was made to determine if there existed any ground


phenomena, including the operation of electronic equipment
in the local area, which could adversely affect the normal
operation of the facilities. Signal strength for proper
reception was measured in appropriate areas, a search for a
reported unauthorized homer was conducted, and the
possibility of spurious radio signals was investigated. After
the work was completed, the spokesman for the FCC team
said nothing was found which would preclude or seriously
impair the normal operation of the approach facilities.

An intense search resulted in the finding of a series of
groundwitnesses who had heard a low-flying aircraft.
Because of weather conditions, consistently described as
cloudy and foggy, none had seen the airplane but a flight
pattern based upon the aircraft engines' sound was revealed.
For several reasons the soundpath was attributable to Flight

349. Most important of the reasons was that the sound
proceeded to and stopped abruptly in the accident area.
Other reasons were the coincidence of time when the aircraft
was heard with the estimated progress of Flight 349, the
knowledge that no other known aircraft operated coincident
with the soundpath, and to some degree the correlation
between the sound movement and Mr. Bradley's
recollections. Because the path was 8-11 miles west of the
airport, a final reason was added when at least three persons
on the airport specifically listening for Flight 349 stated they
did not hear it.


The aircraft was heard by the series of witnesses between
2020-2045. The first of the series were located 8-10 miles
northeast of the accident location. One of them, located on
high terrain near Gibson Mountain, stated the aircraft passed
over on a westerly heading and it was so low "it rattled the
trees." Other witnesses were positioned along a south-
southwest line which was approximately parallel to but 8-
miles west of the normal approach path from Rochelle to the
airport. Most of these witnesses said the engines sounded
normal but as if the aircraft were low. Several in the area of
White Hall, Crozet, and Afton heard the plane approaching
from the northeast. They indicated that from the sound the
aircraft then made a turn from the southwesterly heading to
a northwesterly heading and proceeded in the direction of
Bucks Elbow Mountain. The direction of the turn was
uncertain. One witness who described the turn said that after
the turn the diminishing engine sound stopped quickly but
that she heard no sound like a crash. Another, closer to the
mountain, heard the aircraft proceed toward the mountain
and at 2045 heard a sound like an explosion. Still another
stated she had not heard the aircraft but did hear a sound like
thunder of short duration. She placed the time after 2035 and
before 2040.

Analysis and Conclusions

Examination of the wreckage of N 55 V revealed no
evidence of malfunction or failure of the airframe or
powerplants. There was no indication of an in-flight fire, all


major components of the aircraft were located in the
immediate crash zone, and it was clearly evident that both
engines and propellers were capable of normal operation
prior to impact. There was nothing found indicating that an
emergency existed before the accident. These findings,
reached by examination of the available physical evidence,
were substantiated by the observations of Mr. Bradley.

For reasons hereinbefore enumerated, the Board is of the
opinion that the soundpath developed from the description
by several groundwitnesses was made by Flight 349. From
the soundpath information it is apparent the aircraft
approached the accident location on a southwesterly course
approximately parallel to the prescribed instrument approach
path from the Rochelle intersection to the Charlottesville
homer, but 8 to 11 miles west of the normal track. The
information shows that the southwesterly course was
maintained to the Crozet area located 8 to 11 miles abeam of
the designated area for the instrument approach procedure
turn. It is clearly apparent that in the Crozet area the flight
executed a turn from its southwesterly heading to a
northwesterly heading. By its amount and its north-south
orientation, this turn was coincident with the turning portion
of the procedure turn immediately prior to the inbound
heading of 342 degrees.

After the turn the flight flew northwest for, as near as can be
determined, a distance of two to four miles and crashed
against the side of Bucks Elbow Mountain. It crashed on


approximately the heading of the inbound portion of the
procedure turn with the landing gear extended. The
elevation of the crash, however, was approximately 400 feet
below the altitude specified for the procedure turn.

From all this evidence it is most apparent to the Board that
the accident took place while the general maneuvering
requirements of the instrument approach were being flown 8
to 11 miles west of the designated maneuvering area
prescribed for the approach.

Because it was apparent that the flight flew a ground track
well west of the desired track, a major investigatory effort
was centered on the possibility that faulty operation of
ground navigational and instrument approach facilities
caused or contributed to the erroneous flightpath. This effort
included exhaustive flight and ground checks. The company
and the Air Carrier Branch of the FAA made several
inspection flights, each using its respective aircraft. In
addition, the Flight Inspection Branch of the FAA made
evaluations of the airway and approach facilities using
specific procedures and an aircraft equipped for the purpose.
This work revealed normal operation of the facilities.

As part of this phase the Board called upon the Federal
Communications Commission to assist. With special
equipment and qualified personnel the FCC team made a
comprehensive investigation covering a wide range of
considerations relative to the performance, reliability, and


installation of the homer beacons. Included were a search for
an unauthorized homer rumored to be in operation, an
investigation of electronic equipment used by local
manufacturers, and an evaluation of signal strength within
the operational range requirements specified for the homer
beacons.

This phase of the investigation revealed no condition which
would impair flight conformity along V-140 or the execution
of a normal instrument approach on the homer facilities.

As previously described, the airborne navigational
equipment was determined by physical evidence to have
been properly tuned for an instrument approach utilizing the
ADF equipment on which the Charlottesville approach was
based. Because of this it was of primary concern to the
investigation whether or not the ADF cockpit presentation
was accurate. Most important in this determination were the
positions of the ADF loops relative to the crash heading and
location. The extended bearings of the red and green ADF
loop positions passed nearly through the location of the
respective homer beacon to which each was tuned. Also, the
angle formed between the bearings subtended an arc at the
homers equal to the distance between them. The Board does
not believe these loop positions to be a matter of
coincidence but rather direct evidence the ADF's were
functioning normally at the time of the accident.
Furthermore, the elapsed time between reporting Rochelle to
the crash apparently exceeded the normal elapsed time from


Rochelle to the inbound heading of the procedure turn by
several minutes. Believing the flight operated in instrument
weather conditions and made the final turn abeam of the
procedure turn area, it is probable the turn was started with
reference to the ADF indications. The Board considers it
improbable that the ADF presentation would be accurate in
showing the aircraft abeam of the facilities and inaccurate
shortly before this indication. It is equally improbable that
such inaccuracy would be followed by an accurate
presentation at the time the crash occurred.

Based on the work performed and the evidence found, it is
the opinion of the Board that this accident occurred for
operational reasons. Consequently, the Board sought a
determination in this area which would account for the
flightpath of the aircraft being parallel to, but 8 to 11 miles
west of, the proper track. It sought a situation which could
develop easily and, because it is probable that Captain
Lavrinc was flying, one which escaped observation by
Copilot Haley. It also sought a situation in which the
precarious lateral error would not be readily detected as such
by either pilot. Because of a number of unknown elements
and the inherent intangibles of the operational situation, it is
doubtful that any analysis can determine the sequence of
events with complete definitiveness. Nevertheless, the Board
believes it reached a determination which best satisfies the
aforestated requisites and the known factors.


It is the opinion of the Board that the laterally erroneous
flightpath developed from an initial navigational error at the
Casanova omni. It is believed it occurred as an omission in
that the flight did not turn in conformity with the V-
airway from the inbound radial of 260 degrees to the
outbound radial of 239 degrees, a left turn of about 20
degrees. It is believed that the flight continued on the 260-
degree radial until it reached the 335-degree radial of the
Gordonsville omni at a location approximately 13 miles
northwest of the Rochelle intersection. It is the Board's
opinion that at this location, which was believed by the
pilots to be Rochelle, the flight turned left to and flew the
approximate heading indicated by the flight plan and log to
be flown from Rochelle, 200 degrees.

The Board has reached its opinion as to the sequence of
events based upon several factors. The first was the results
of an analytical time, distance, and groundspeed plot. It is
probable that the flight flew about 15 minutes after reporting
Rochelle until it crashed. This time, being considerably
longer than the time normally required to fly from Rochelle
to the inbound heading of the procedure turn, shows a
greater distance must have been flown. A plot of the
probable flightpath in reverse was therefore prepared using
the time flown, a reciprocal of the soundpath, and the
estimated groundspeed of the DC-3. This showed that 15
minutes before the accident the aircraft would have been
over an area about 13 miles northwest of Rochelle
intersection.


The second phase of this work was a radius of action plot
from the Casanova omni. Based on the elapsed time between
the Casanova and Rochelle reports, 15 minutes, it was
determined that the flight would have flown 33 miles. A line
of position with a radius of 33 miles from Casanova was
found to intersect the initial plot at a location which was
approximately 15 minutes from the crash or again about 13
miles northwest of Rochelle.

At the completion of this work two additional significant
factors were apparent. The point of intersection of the plots
was closely coincident with the 335-degree radial of
Gordonsville. Secondly, the heading to the location of
intersecting plots from Casanova was the 260-degree radial
of Casanova and the same as the inbound radial to Casanova
from Springfield.

At Casanova Copilot Haley made the position report and
most probably recorded it in the flight plan and log.
Thereafter he would be expected to tune his omni set to the
Gordonsville frequency and select the 335-degree radial in
order to identify the Rochelle intersection. Considering the
small amount of turn required at this time, the first actions
could have diverted his attention for the period during which
the captain would normally have made the turn. Tuning his
omni to Gordonsville, though necessary, would also reduce
his opportunity to observe by omni indications the relative
position of the aircraft to the course of the airway.
Additionally, there was indication that Captain Lavrinc flew


with a lower than average level of instrument panel
illumination. In the Board's opinion these factors are valid
reasons in this instance for the copilot not having detected
the navigational omission.

After reporting Rochelle and turning to the southwest
heading it is likely that both pilots believed the aircraft was
describing a groundpath west of, but only a short distance
west of, the normal track from Rochelle to the
Charlottesville homer. It is the Board's opinion that at this
time the flight was, in fact, 13 miles northwest of Rochelle.
While this position was only two to three miles farther than
Rochelle from the Casanova omni, the position placed the
southwest course of the flight eight to nine miles west of the
specified track. The location also positioned the flight about
10 miles farther from the homer facilities than from the
Rochelle intersection.

It is believed that this latter factor could work to obscure the
lateral error which existed during the southwest portion of
the flightpath. The greater distance from the signal source
would reduce the angular displacement of the ADF
presentation. Thus, if the aircraft was positioned 10 miles
farther from the signal source than it was believed to be by
its pilots, the angular deflection of the ADF presentation
caused by the lateral course error could be obscured
considerably by the greater distance. For example, the ADF
presentation 24 miles from the signal source and eight to
nine miles west of track is not alarmingly different than the


presentation 12 miles from the signal source and three miles
west of the prescribed track. Similarly, the ADF presentation
19 miles from the signal source and eight to nine miles west
of track is not alarmingly different than the presentation
seven miles from the signal source and three miles west of
the track desired. In addition, as the flight progressed toward
the facilities but from a greater distance than believed by the
pilots, the increasing angular displacement of the ADF
needles showing lateral error could be interpreted as a
closure on the signal source. The Board believes the
foregoing discussion to be a valid consideration in the
reason that the pilots were not alerted early in the approach
to the large lateral track error.

On the other hand, the Board is aware that as the flight
proceeded on the southwest course the rate of progression of
the ADF needles to the left 90-degree abeam indication
would have been much slower as the result of the greater
distance and time to be flown. At the 90-degree position the
angular spread between the needles would have been much
narrower 9 to 10 miles west of the homers than three to four
miles west of the homers. Further, 90 degrees abeam of the
signal source, a 20-degree relative bearing change on a
flightpath three to four miles west of the homer, would take
30 to 40 seconds as contrasted to approximately 1-1/2
minutes on a flightpath about nine miles west of the homer.
In addition, the ADF presentation during the period the
flight turned from the southwest heading until it struck the
mountain would have been incompatible with a close-in


position. The Board believes that these factors should have
served to alert an attentive pilot that the lateral course error
was of considerable magnitude.

During the course of the investigation the aeronautical
history of Captain Lavrinc was reviewed. His training,
qualifications, and proficiency reports were satisfactory. His
history showed that he had progressed normally to captain
and had served in that capacity since May 1957. It also
showed that he had flown in and out of Charlottesville and
over the route involved for several years on a regular basis.
Captain Lavrinc had flown a total of 5,101 hours, of which
4,771 were in DC-3 aircraft.

To the Board there were numerous factors which were
obviously inconsistent with Captain Lavrinc's record. Some
were. The apparent navigational omission, a nonadherence
to precise tracking procedures, and a descent below the
authorized procedure turn altitude. Others were: The failure
to note that the time for station passage was in excess of that
commensurate with a close-in position, and that ADF
indications were not compatible with the normal procedure
turn presentation. Still others were a failure to request the
latest Charlottesville weather when the communicator did
not furnish it, and not using the altimeter setting given in
response to the inrange report. The Board believes these
factors were not only inconsistent with Captain Lavrinc's
reputation as an exacting pilot but were indicative of a
serious departure from the high standard and quality of


performance expected during an instrument operation.
Because of these factors a comprehensive investigation was
made into the personal background of Captain Lavrinc. This
was done to search for reasons which could seriously impair
his normal piloting ability. During this work reasons were
found which could result in his preoccupation.

Captain Lavrinc had, for several years, been under severe
emotional strain. The Board considers that disclosure of
detailed information relating thereto would adversely affect
the interests of certain persons and is not required in the
interest of the public. A resume of the Board's significant
findings and certain recommendations, however, are in the
public interest and are set forth below.

Captain Lavrinc received psychotherapy in 1953-1954; he
obtained further psychiatric counseling in 1957; intensive
psychotherapy was resumed in May 1959, which he
underwent several times a week thereafter; his last
appointment was the night before the accident. This latter
treatment involved the services of two psychiatrists. In the
course of this treatment the first psychiatrist prescribed
certain psychotropic drugs. After trials on Compazine,
Prozine, Sparine, and Thorazine, Prozine was prescribed in
August 1959 in a dosage of three or four times daily and was
reissued on September 18, 1959. This prescription specified
an amount which, if taken as directed, would have been
sufficient to last until two days before the accident.


On September 23, 1959, however, Captain Lavrinc
commenced psychotherapy under the second psychiatrist
who prescribed no drugs. The Board has been unable to
determine whether or not Captain Lavrinc continued to take
the medicine in the prescribed manner during the latter
treatments, although there is evidence that he took the earlier
trial prescriptions.

The Board has evaluated the background and history of
Captain Lavrinc, including data set forth above. In addition,
it submitted all the available information covering Captain
Lavrinc to particularly qualified medical experts for
evaluation as to its significance with respect to this accident.

The consensus is that Captain Lavrinc was so heavily
burdened with mental and emotional problems that he
should have been relieved of the strain of flight duty while
undergoing treatment for his condition. This condition was
such that preoccupation with his problems could well have
lowered his standard of performance during instrument
flight. Furthermore, with respect to this accident the
consensus is that the emotional and mental problems were of
far greater importance in causing the preoccupation than
could have the use of psychotropic medication.

The Board believes that the facts disclosed by this
investigation demonstrate the adverse effects of serious
emotional and mental stress on airman proficiency and
performance. It further believes that the early recognition


and correction of such conditions which might tend to
impair an airman's proficiency and performance would be
beneficial to flight safety. Accordingly, the Board
recommends that the Federal Aviation Agency, appropriate
segments of the aviation industry, and the medical
profession initiate exploratory studies in this field.

The Board also considers that the investigation of this
accident demonstrates the need for reexamination of the use
of drugs which may affect the faculties of a flight crew
member in any manner contrary to safety.

Since World War II there have been great advances in
pharmacology and whole new families of drugs have
become easily available to the public, either over the counter
or by prescription. Since 1953-1954 one of the most
significant advances has been in the field of
psychopharmacology. There has been a proliferation of
drugs which influence the state of mind, are employed in the
treatment of mental disorders, or are used as psychic
energizers. Within this group of drugs the so-called
tranquilizers are being widely used by the public.

The basic question which the Board believes must be
resolved, therefore, is how does the use of these drugs relate
to the safety of flight. For example, within the framework of
the present Civil Airt Regulation covering the use of drugs,
[ 5 ] should these drugs be classified as "... drug which

affects his (crew member) faculties in any manner contrary


to safety.. ." The Board is of the opinion that the answer to
the question is a qualified "yes." In great part this decision is
reached from review of military research into the
relationship of drugs to the flying profession. The basic
conclusion derived from this research can be stated quite
simply: If a flight crew member's personal situation
demands tranquilizers he should be removed from flying
status while on the drugs.

Probable Cause

The Board determines that the probable cause of this
accident was a navigational omission which resulted in a
lateral course error that was not detected and corrected
through precision instrument flying procedures.

A contributing factor to the accident may have been
preoccupation of the captain resulting from mental stress.

#### SUPPLEMENTAL DATA

Investigation and Hearing

The Civil Aeronautics Board was notified of the accident
shortly after the flight was presumed to have crashed. Board
investigators were immediately dispatched to Charlottesville
and participated in the search and rescue activity until the
aircraft was located. Thereafter, an investigation was
initiated and conducted in accordance with the provisions of
Title VII of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. A public
hearing was held in conjunction with the investigation in
Charlottesville, Virginia, December 10–11, 1959.


Air Carrier

Piedmont Airlines is the Airline Division of Piedmont
Aviation, Inc. The company is incorporated in North
Carolina with its principal offices in Winston-Salem, North
Carolina. The Piedmont Airlines Division of the company
was established in 1947. It operates under a currently
effective certificate of public convenience and necessity
issued to the company by the Civil Aeronautics Board and
an air carrier operating certificate issued by the Federal
Aviation Agency. These authorize the company to transport
by air persons, property, and mail over various routes
including the one involved in the accident.

Flight Personnel

Captain George Lavrinc, age 32, was employed by Piedmont
Aviation January 23, 1950. He was employed in the radio
department and transferred to the Airline Division
November 24, 1951. He was promoted to reserve captain on
May 1, 1957. Captain Lavrinc held a valid FAA airline
transport pilot certificate with a DC-3 aircraft rating.
Company records showed he had flown 5,101 hours, of
which 4,771 were in DC-3 aircraft. His last first-class
medical mas satisfactorily accomplished October 13, 1959.
His last semiannual proficiency flight check was
satisfactorily accomplished May 26, 1959.

First Office Bascom L Haley, age 27, was employed by
Piedmont Airlines on May 2, 1957 He held a valid FAA


commercial pilot certificate with an instrument rating.
According to company records he had accumulated 2,858
hours, of which 1,678 were in DC-3 aircraft. His last first-
class medical examination was satisfactorily accomplished
May 12, 1959.

The Aircraft

DC-3, N 55V, was manufactured June 2, 1944, and procured
by Piedmont Aviation on January 24, 1955. It had been
flown a total of 26,339 hours. The aircraft had been flown
83 hours since the last No. 4 inspection. The engines were
Pratt and Whitney, model R-1830092, equipped with
Hamilton Standard model 23E50 propellers.
